# AffinityPredictor
AffinityPredictor is a machine learning project aimed at enhancing user experience in online dating platforms. It leverages real-world behavioral data from speed dating experiments to build a predictive model capable of identifying potential mutual matches.

### üîç Project Overview
In today‚Äôs digital age, the way people build interpersonal relationships has changed dramatically. Online dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge have become widespread, especially among younger generations.

Although these platforms rely on modern technology, the decision-making dynamics behind them often resemble traditional settings like **speed dating** events. This project uses a rich dataset from such experiments as a foundation for building an intelligent recommendation system.

The ultimate goal is to implement a **machine learning classifier** for a hypothetical dating app. The system predicts whether a person would want to meet another individual in real life, based on a wide range of input features: user demographics, personal interests, and preferences.

The objective is to move beyond basic manual filters (like age range or distance) and introduce a more personalized and efficient approach to matchmaking.

### üî¨ Further Analysis
The `further_analysis/` folder contains **key experiments and advanced preprocessing techniques** aimed at improving the performance of our machine learning classifiers. These are not auxiliary or side studies ‚Äî they represent a core component of the project‚Äôs second phase, where deeper investigation and optimization were carried out.

These analyses focus on refining the feature space, rebalancing the dataset, and comparing additional classification strategies. The experiments were guided by the goal of boosting model accuracy, generalization, and fairness.

### üß† Features
- Preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and transforming the dataset
